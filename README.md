## Project overview
### Required for project 
#### Hardware
- [Adafruit Feather NRF52](https://learn.adafruit.com/bluefruit-nrf52-feather-learning-guide?view=all)
-  [adxl335 Accelerometer modle](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/SMD/adxl335.pdf)
- RGB LED
#### Software
- [Unity](https://store.unity.com/download) 
- [Unity BLE Plugin](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/network/bluetooth-le-for-ios-tvos-and-android-26661)

### Aims of Project
- Goal of the project is to demonstrate that any BLE microcontroller will be able to connect to a unity project
- The main example of the BLE Unity library connects a RFDuino module to a unity project, but any BLE device should be able to be connected.
- To Demonstrate this, I will have the device connect via bluetooth LE to the Unity Game runnung on a phone.
- As the device is tilted a cube on the unity program will also tilt.  
- This is the proof of concept mainly to show connection with Unity.

### Unity code
The most important part of the unity code is the connection to BLE
```
private string _FullUID = "6e40****-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e"; //Default UUID from adaFruit nrf52
    private string _serviceUUID = "0001"; // service characteristic
    private string _readCharacteristicUUID = "0003"; 
    private string _writeCharacteristicUUID = "0002";
    private string deviceToConnectTo = "_TimsBluefruit52"; //change to name given to module on Arduino code

```
- This is what is defines the device, the FullUID is the UART service definition
- The name of the device is what is defined in the arduino code
- Unity is subscribing to the UART serial read of the arduino and parsing out the XYZ read from the accelerometer.
- The block on the screen in turn changes color to what the LED shows on the RGB arduino
